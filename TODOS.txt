- Make it so that end of combat doesn't immediately close the combat page
    - Display loot from the fight (if any)
- Fix level up wizard
- Make battle maps for combat grid background
- Give tokens pictures
- Add in AOE markers
- Make lobby system so multiple players can join a session
- Create ai generated plot story which they will guide the user through
    - Perhaps have a list of plot points and storylines that they will take the player through
- Subclasses have their own features... Have to implement this similar to current features I think?
