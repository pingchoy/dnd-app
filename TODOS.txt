- Make it so that end of combat doesn't immediately close the combat page
    - Display loot from the fight (if any)
- Fix level up wizard
    - Especially spell slots
- Make battle maps for combat grid background
- Give tokens pictures
- Add in AOE markers
- Make lobby system so multiple players can join a session
- Create ai generated plot story which they will guide the user through
    - Perhaps have a list of plot points and storylines that they will take the player through
- Subclasses have their own features... Have to implement this similar to current features I think?
- Allow short rest/long rest with deterministic button logic
- Find a better way of displaying money. 1 gp -> 10 silver -> 100 copper
- Need to figure out action economy in combat. Actions + bonus actions 
- Update spell effects for all spells......
- Enable armour equip/unequip 
    - Need to also handle conditions when equipping and unequipping like unarmoured/holding shield/dual wielding/etc.
- Design better way of handling abilities in combat screen. Currently when chat opens it obscures the abilities section
- instead of activeNPCs, maybe we track "hostileNPCs" so we can keep track of HP for the dm to narrate even after they die 
- I don't think spell levels work in combat?
- Need to reprompt the combat agent. IT currently doesn't display how much damage is done to the player in the flavour text
