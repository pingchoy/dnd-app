- Fix level up wizard
    - feats
- Make battle maps for combat grid background
- Give tokens pictures
- Add in AOE markers
- Make lobby system so multiple players can join a session
- Create ai generated plot story which they will guide the user through
    - Perhaps have a list of plot points and storylines that they will take the player through
- Subclasses have their own features... Have to implement this similar to current features I think?
- Allow short rest/long rest with deterministic button logic
- Find a better way of displaying money. 1 gp -> 10 silver -> 100 copper
- Need to figure out action economy in combat. Actions + bonus actions 
- Update spell effects for all spells......
- Enable armour equip/unequip 
    - Need to also handle conditions when equipping and unequipping like unarmoured/holding shield/dual wielding/etc.
- I don't think spell levels work in combat?
    - Spells also don't use spell slots in combat
- Need to reprompt the combat agent. It currently doesn't display how much damage is done to the player in the flavour text
- When a npc dies it instantly vanishes before we can see the hit and damage. Let's update it so that we see the damage and then it fades out with a skull icon
