  "backstory": "Xavier grew up in the bustling city of Evershade, a place teeming with crime and corruption. Orphaned at a young age, he learned to survive on the streets by picking pockets and running errands for local thieves' guilds. Despite his rough upbringing, Xavier has a strong moral compass and often uses his skills to help those in need. His half-elven heritage gives him an edge in both agility and charm, making him a valuable ally and a cunning adversary."
